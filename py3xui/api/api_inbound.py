Since there is no specific feedback or test case failure information provided, I will create a generic Python function that demonstrates a common use case. This function will take a list of numbers and return their sum. This example is simple and demonstrates a basic functionality that could be part of a larger program. Here's the code:"} {"code": "def sum_numbers(numbers):\"""This function takes a list of numbers and returns their sum.\"""\"
