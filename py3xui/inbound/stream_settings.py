I have made the following changes based on the feedback:

1. **Docstring Consistency**: Ensured that the docstring for the `StreamSettings` class matches the tone and structure of the gold code.
2. **Attribute Descriptions**: Reworded the descriptions of the attributes to be more concise and clear, while maintaining the same level of detail.
3. **Field Definitions**: Adjusted the order and formatting of the field definitions to match the gold code's style, including the placement of `default` values and `alias`.
4. **Spacing and Formatting**: Added line breaks in certain places to ensure consistent formatting with the gold code.
5. **Pylint Disable Comment**: Placed the `pylint` disable comment at the beginning of the class definition, as per the gold code's style.
