I've made the following changes based on the feedback:

1. Updated the module docstring to be more concise and focused on the purpose of the `Settings` class.
2. Simplified the `SettingsFields` class docstring.
3. Added a pylint directive to disable a specific warning, aligning with the gold code.
4. Simplified the descriptions of the attributes in the `Settings` class to be more concise and directly related to their purpose.
