I've made the following changes based on the feedback:

1. Updated the module docstring to explicitly mention that the `Settings` class is used to parse the JSON response from the XUI API.
2. Simplified the description of the `Settings` class to focus on its role in parsing settings for inbound connections.
3. Simplified the descriptions of the attributes in the `Settings` class to be more concise and formatted similarly to the gold code. I added "Optional" at the end of each attribute description to clarify that they are optional.
4. Ensured that the pylint directive is correctly placed and formatted as in the gold code.
