The provided feedback indicates that the tests are failing, but the specific reason for the failure is not clear. Since the oracle has no feedback to provide, it suggests that the issue might be related to the environment or setup rather than the code itself. Therefore, the junior developer should focus on ensuring that their environment is correctly set up and that all necessary dependencies are installed. If the tests are still failing, they should check for any discrepancies in their setup, such as incorrect versions of libraries or misconfigurations. Additionally, they should review other code interactions to ensure that there are no conflicts or issues that could be causing the failures. For now, the code remains unchanged, and the developer should concentrate on resolving the test failures by addressing the setup and dependency issues.
